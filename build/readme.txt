We provide a Windows Visual Studio 2015 project ready to compile and run. Simply build and run "PairTree.exe ..\..\..\..\..\src\example.lua"

If you wish to compile on your own, please make sure to:
- Add directories /src/lua/ and /src/luabridge to include directories
- Link obj/lua52.lib
- If on Windows, copy obj/lua52.dll your executable folder
